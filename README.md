Image Exercise
there are two images we will be working with:
word_matrix.png
mask.png
The word_matrix is a .png image that contains a spreadsheet of words with a hidden message in it.
Your task is to use the mask.png image to reveal the hidden message inside the word_matrix.png. Keep in mind, you may need to make changes to the mask.png in order for this to work.
